        I am a senior student in Seoul National University and will graduate in Feb, 2019.
        I am interested in enhancing our comprehension of the world by creating unprecedented user experience
        at the boundary of display and photonics.
        In particular, my research interests include Computational Imaging, Optimization of optical systems, 3D Displays, Light Fields, and Light Transport. <br><br>

        Hi, I am a first-year PhD student at Stanford University in Electrical Engineering, working as a part of <a class=aboutme href="http://www.computationalimaging.org">Stanford Computational Imaging Lab</a>,
        advised by Prof. <a class=aboutme href="http://web.stanford.edu/~gordonwz">Gordon Wetztsein</a>. I am interested in developing 3D display hardware systems with novel algorithmic frameworks. Generally my research interests include computational displays, optimization techniques for optical systems, and light transport.
        I am supported by a <a class=aboutme href="http://en.ikef.or.kr/">Kwanjeong Scholarship</a> and a <a class=aboutme href="http://www.niied.go.kr/user/nd70479.do">Korea Government Scholarship</a>.<br><br>


        Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in <a class=aboutme href="http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en">ECE</a> at <a class=aboutme href="http://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a>,
        where I was fortunate to be a recipient of <a class=aboutme href="http://www.kosaf.go.kr/eng/jsp/main.jsp">The Presidential Science Scholarship</a> and be advised by Prof.
        <a class=aboutme href="http://isdl.snu.ac.kr/korean/viewforum.php?f=5">Deog-Kyoon Jeong</a>,
        Prof. <a class=aboutme href="http://altair.snu.ac.kr/~smoon/">Soo-Mook Moon,</a> and
        Prof. <a class=aboutme href="http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF">Byoungho Lee</a>.
        Before that, I was a silver medalist at the <a class=aboutme href="http://ipho.org/">IPhO (International Physics Olympiad)</a> 2012.

        <br><br>
        <!--
        From Aug 2015 to May 2017, I served in the Crime Prevention Police Company at Seoul Eunpyeong Police Station and the
        <a class=aboutme href="http://cyberbureau.police.go.kr/eng/index.do">
          Korean National Police Agency Cyber Bureau
        </a>
         as a substitute for military service. There, I worked as a full-stack software engineer and managed the national performance management system.
