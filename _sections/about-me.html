        I am a senior student in Seoul National University and will graduate in Feb, 2019.
        I am interested in enhancing our comprehension of the world by creating unprecedented user experience
        at the boundary of display and photonics.
        In particular, my research interests include Computational Imaging, Optimization of optical systems, 3D Displays, Light Fields, and Light Transport. <br><br>

        !-->
        I am a first-year MSc student at Stanford University EE department and supported by Kwanjeong Scholarship and Korea Government Scholarship.
        My research interests include computational displays/imaging, optimization techniques for optical systems, and light transport. <br><br>

        I was born in Seoul, Korea in 1994. I was a silver medalist at the <a class=aboutme href="http://ipho.org/">IPhO (International Physics Olympiad)</a> 2012.
        As graduating from <a class=aboutme href="http://en.sshs.hs.kr/html/index.php">Seoul Science High School</a> in 2013,
        I entered <a class=aboutme href="http://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a> majoring in <a class=aboutme href="http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>.
        I was a recipient of <a class=aboutme href="http://www.kosaf.go.kr/eng/jsp/main.jsp">Presidential Science Scholarship</a> for undergraduate study.

        <br><br>
        From Aug 2015 to May 2017, I served in the Crime Prevention Police Company at Seoul Eunpyeong Police Station and the
        <a class=aboutme href="http://cyberbureau.police.go.kr/eng/index.do">
          Korean National Police Agency Cyber Bureau
        </a>
         as a substitute for military service. There, I worked as a full-stack software engineer and managed the national performance management system.
        <br><br>
        During my undergraduate, I was advised by Profs.
        <a class=aboutme href="http://isdl.snu.ac.kr/korean/viewforum.php?f=5">Deog-Kyoon Jeong</a>,
        <a class=aboutme href="http://altair.snu.ac.kr/~smoon/">Soo-Mook Moon,</a> and
        <a class=aboutme href="http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF">Byoungho Lee</a>. <br><br>
        <!-- I am working in <a class=aboutme href="http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr">OEQELAB</a> as a research intern. !-->
        Here at Stanford, I am fortunate to work with Prof. Gordon Wetzstein.
