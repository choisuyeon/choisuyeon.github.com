        I am a senior student in Seoul National University and will graduate in Feb, 2019. I am interested in developing 3D Display with comfortable UX.
        In particular, my research interests include Computational Imaging, 3D Displays, Light Transport and Computer Vision. <br><br>

        I was born in Seoul, Korea in 1994. I was a silver medalist at the <a class=aboutme href="http://ipho.org/">IPhO (International Physics Olypiad)</a> 2012.
        As graduating from <a class=aboutme href="http://www.sshs.hs.kr/">Seoul Science High School</a> in 2013,
        I entered <a class=aboutme href="http://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a> majoring in <a class=aboutme href="http://ee.snu.ac.kr/en">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>.
        I was a recipient of <a class=aboutme href="http://eng.kosaf.go.kr/jsp/aid/aid02_01_01.jsp?ttab1=2">Presidential Science Scholarship</a> for undergraduate study.
        <br><br>
        From Aug 2015 to May 2017, I worked for Seoul Eunpyeong Police Station and
        <a class=aboutme href="http://cyberbureau.police.go.kr/eng/index.do">
          Cyber Bureau, Korean National Police Agency
        </a>
         as a substitute for military service. In there, I worked as a full-stack software engineer and managed the national performance management system.
        <br><br>
        Now I am working in <a class=aboutme href="http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr">OEQELAB</a> as a research intern.
