        Hi, I am a second-year PhD student working as a part of <a class=aboutme href="http://www.computationalimaging.org">Stanford Computational Imaging Lab</a>,
        advised by Prof. <a class=aboutme href="http://web.stanford.edu/~gordonwz">Gordon Wetzstein</a>. I am generally interested in developing 3D display hardware systems with novel algorithmic frameworks. Lately, I have been developing <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/neuralholography/>holographic display systems incorporating machine learning</a> towards next-generataion VR/AR displays.
        My research has been partly supported by a <a class=aboutme href="https://research.facebook.com/fellowship/">Meta Research PhD Fellowship</a>, a <a class=aboutme href="http://en.ikef.or.kr/">Kwanjeong Scholarship</a>, a Korean Government Scholarship, and <a class=aboutme href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090/">a GPU gift</a> from NVIDIA.<br><br>

        I received my Master's degree in EE at Stanford University. Previously, I did my undergrad at <a class=aboutme href="http://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a>,
        where I was fortunate to be a recipient of <a class=aboutme href="http://www.kosaf.go.kr/eng/jsp/main.jsp">The Presidential Science Scholarship</a> and be advised by Prof.
        <a class=aboutme href="http://isdl.snu.ac.kr/?page_id=26">Deog-Kyoon Jeong</a>,
        Prof. <a class=aboutme href="http://altair.snu.ac.kr/smoon/">Soo-Mook Moon,</a> and
        Prof. <a class=aboutme href="http://oeqelab.snu.ac.kr/PROF">Byoungho Lee</a>.
