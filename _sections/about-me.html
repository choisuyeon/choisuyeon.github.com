        I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en">Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University</a>.
        My research focuses on developing novel algorithms and optical systems at the intersection of graphics, optics, artificial intelligence, and vision science.
        During my PhD, I developed <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/neuralholography/>holographic</a> <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/neuralholography3d/>display</a> <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/time-multiplexed-neural-holography/>systems</a> <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/michelsonholography/>incorporating</a> <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/holographic-glasses/>machine</a> <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/partiallycoherentholography/>learning</a> towards next-generation <a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/synthetic-aperture-waveguide-holography>VR</a>/<a href=https://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/holographicar>AR</a> displays, and my thesis received the <a href=https://www.siggraph.org/awards/outstanding-doctoral-dissertation-award/>ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Dissertation Award Honorable Mention</a> in 2025.
        My research has been supported by a <a href="https://research.facebook.com/fellowship/">Meta Research PhD Fellowship</a>, a <a href="https://spie.org/membership/student-hub/scholarships/optics-and-photonics-education-scholarships">SPIE Optics and Photonics Education Scholarship</a>, a <a href="http://en.ikef.or.kr/">Kwanjeong Scholarship</a>, a Korean Government Scholarship, and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090/">a GPU gift</a> from NVIDIA. 
        I did my PhD at Stanford University with Prof. <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~gordonwz">Gordon Wetzstein</a> and undergrad at Seoul National University. <br><br>
