        I am thrilled to share that I will be joining <a class=aboutme href="https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en">the Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a class=aboutme href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/">Seoul National University</a> as a tenure-track assistant professor in March 2026! 
        At SNU CSE, I will be building a diverse and collaborative research group focused on advancing computational physical systems at the intersection of graphics, optics, electronics/robotics, and AI—with applications in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_computing">spatial computing</a>, scientific imaging, and beyond: 
        If you're excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with modern physical systems by combining physics and AI, let's chat! Feel free to <a href="mailto:suyeon@stanford.edu" class="aboutme">reach out through email</a> if you're interested in joining my lab in SNU next year.
