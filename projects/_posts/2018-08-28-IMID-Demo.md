summary: Near-eye displays with focus cues attracts a lot of attention from display society since they can provide more immersive and comfort experience. However, there are several challenging issues &#58; contrast, form factor, and frame rate. Here, we conceived a novel prototype that supports a large number of layers within the wide depth of field. This system could provide semi-original contrast, large depth of field, and quasi-continuous focus cues at 60fps. We believe this approach could open a new possibility for near-eye displays for representation of continuous depth.
