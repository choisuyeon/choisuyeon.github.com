summary: With the revolution in IT technology, a number of centralized services are being offered, It penetrates into people's daily lives. Users who use these services will be assuming a "belief" that companies will not use their own personal information. But as you can see from the Facebook personal information leakage recently, it has been proven again that a problem (or a threat to a malicious attack) cannot be eliminated ultimately. From this perspective, companies offering Git services (Github, Bitbucket, etc.), cannot escape this threat. In this study, we propose Gitchain, a decentralized version control system using blockchain network. This enables a reliable and efficient file sharing without a third party, and a version management system that can solve the synchronization problem.

      <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
      <br>

      With the revolution in IT technology, a number of centralized services are being offered, It penetrates into people's daily lives. Users who use these services will be assuming a "belief" that companies will not use their own personal information. But as you can see from the Facebook personal information leakage recently, it has been proven again that a problem (or a threat to a malicious attack) cannot be eliminated ultimately. From this perspective, companies offering Git services (Github, Bitbucket, etc.), cannot escape this threat. In this study, we propose Gitchain, a decentralized version control system using blockchain network. This enables a reliable and efficient file sharing without a third party, and a version management system that can solve the synchronization problem. We devised novel protocol and implemented a prototype.
