summary: I devised an eye-tracker setup and developed the helper module for pupil-labs products in Python &#40;published on PyPI and Github&#41; as a part of near-eye display project. To reduce the form factor, we tried to eliminate World Camera of Eye tracker, thus had to implement our own calibration function. To calibrate eye-tracker data, we collect some data before measuring based on target prepared and process it by using K-mean clustering and affine transform.

  <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
  <br>
  I devised an eye-tracker setup and developed the helper module for pupil-labs products in Python &#40;published on PyPI and <a href="https://github.com/choisuyeon/pypupil" class="aboutme">Github</a>&#41;.
  as a part of near-eye display project. To reduce the form factor, we tried to eliminate World Camera of Eye tracker, thus had to implement our own calibration function.
  To calibrate eye-tracker data, we collect some data before measuring based on target prepared and process it by using K-mean clustering and affine transform. The results are shown on the right.
  You can check out more functions that eases your data processing on <a href="https://choisuyeon.github.io/docs-pypupil/" class="aboutme" style='font-style:italic;'>pypupil-docs.</a>
